          <h3>hey, that's me!</h3>
          <p>Hi, I'm Lindsay.</p>
          <p>
            I’m a people person. An optimist. An extrovert. When we meet, I will 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://brooklynplaces.tumblr.com/post/80718353994/hugs-for-all-my-friend-ashley-designed-these-for">ug</a>
            you hello.My dad has always told me that everyone has a story. What's yours?<br><br>
            I recently left my 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wecharitywater.tumblr.com/">awesome job</a> 
            at a NY-based non-profit called 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charitywater.org/">charity: water</a>. 
            I'm on a mission to discover my next great adventure, starting with fifty coffees to figure it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last three years working at charity: water were a huge growth period for me. I am ready for a big career move, but don't want to blindly jump into the next thing. Instead, I want to be intentional about my next work experience; thoughtful about my life path. This moment feels important. I live in the best city in the world --New York City, I have ten years of work experience, and I don't yet have kids. and I'm in a position where I can take a risk. fifty coffees is my personal preparation to start leaning in. A casual little blog; a systematic approach to narrowing the field in a world with endless choice.
            </p>
            <h3>the idea of the project is simple.</h3>
            <p>
              Over the next year, I will meet with fifty of my friends and mentors to gather advice and share perspectives to help define the next chapter of my life. I'll blog about the people & experience
            </p>
            <p>
              My work and life experiences during my 20's were weird and wild. I did everything from live at the Chateau Marmont Hotel for a year to dance with rural Ethiopian kids in Tigray. As a result, there are a lot of fascinating people in my life. I enjoy cultivating relationships and creating communities with people who constantly shock me with their greatness. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to do my best to surround myself with dreamers, doers, believers, and thinkers because I want my world to continue to expand. I want to do more, learn more, see more -- while surrounded by life-loving people like you. Wanna grab a coffee?
            </p>
            <h3>goals:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Get out of my apartment</li>
              <li>Demand discipline of myself </li>
              <li>Take photos</li>
              <li>Spend time with friends</li>
              <li>Write</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We'll 
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/coffee-talk/n10218">coffee talk</a>
              (or have conversations during a farm stroll, hat factory tour, or yoga class if that makes more sense). I'll ask questions about your journey, and perhaps gather opinions you may have about mine.
            </p>
            <h3>how did this idea begin?</h3>
            <p>
              During my last week at charity: water, one of my favorite coworkers, Paull Young, and I went to coffee. We talked about the potential in my next career steps and he talked about an article he'd recently read on INC.com titled "
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inc.com/peter-thomson/50-cups-of-coffee.html">How 50 Cups of Coffee Can Change Your Life</a>." 
              The thesis of the article is that when in big transition moments, people should sit down with 50 people to gather a variety of perspectives and relevant advice. "Setting the goal of having coffee with 50 people forces you to be clear about your goals. Making the goal public, one person at a time, also makes it much stronger. You’ll also get input from smart and interesting people."
            </p>
            <p><strong>PERFECT.</strong></p>
            <p>
              This concept is not new. There's a widely read article from August 2011 by VC Mark Suster called 
              "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1773958/why-you-need-take-50-coffee-meetings">Why You Need To Take 50 Coffee Meetings</a>," 
              a blog called 
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.52cups.com/">52 Cups of Coffee</a>- 
              a year long project started by a college student looking to meet 52 new people to expand her horizons (awesome), and well-known self help book 
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Color-Your-Parachute-2014/dp/1607743620"><em>What Color is Your Parachute</em></a> 
              mentions the concept of taking 50 informational meetings when job hunting.
            </p>
            <p>fifty coffees is my personal spin. </p>
            <p>
              Get ready to meet my favorite taste makers, spiritual guides, and thought leaders. Maybe their words of advice will spark something in you, too.
