          <p>
            Hey everyone! I’ve been on hiatus because — as was the original intention of this blog — I Co-Founded and run a media company with renowned relationship expert, Esther Perel. Esther is a psychotherapist, New York Times best-selling author, and TED Talk all-star who I interviewed as one of my coffee dates (interview forthcoming). We've been working our tails off to help people better navigate modern relationships. What I'm learning is, even once you get the perfect job, you must continue to learn and grow. I have a whole new set of questions for my peeps, so I'm getting back in the coffees ring. Kicking back off with my favorite human. Stay tuned...

            <strong>How we know each other</strong>
            <br>
            Paull (with two 'L's) gave me the idea to start fifty coffees. A-HA!
          </p>
          <p>
            PY and I worked together at charity: water for almost three years. We first met at a cw event in San Francisco, before I was officially hired. His positive energy, enthusiasm, and accent (he’s Australian) immediately drew me in. We're both extroverts who are fueled by social interactions and learning new stuff. He is a connector, a mover & a shaker, a very intelligent, well spoken guy. And Youngy (as his rugby mates call him) has always been a big cheerleader of mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is responsible for a lot of the big partnerships charity: water has benefitted from over the years, including being one of the highlighted companies when Instagram launched their 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/article/digital/meet-brands-instagram-video/242753/">video platform</a> 
            in 2013. But more impressively, he wrote and performed <a target="_blank" href="http://wecharitywater.tumblr.com/page/2">an original rap</a> about his team at our annual staff holiday party. LEGEND.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Discoveries</strong>
            <br>
            My coffee date with Paull is the origin story of this project. Sipping non-dairy lattes, we brainstormed job ideas based on what he thinks I'm good at (building community, developing relationships, representing people and brands, authentic "networking"). What type of position and company will help me leverage my people skills? What companies really value relationship building?
          </p>
          <p>
            I was invigorated hearing an outsider's perspective on my skill set (I was big-time questioning whether or not I even had one of those). Oh, right, I'm personable. People trust me. Ok, this is good.
          </p>
          <p>
            He told me to read 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestartupofyou.com/">Reid Hoffman's book</a>. 
            He also told me about an article he'd read a few months ago in FastCompany or Inc or Wired about a guy in the San Francisco tech space (maybe? he couldn't exactly remember) who recommended that you set up a bunch of casual coffee meetings when in a transitional work phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is interesting. A transition period blog. I could do this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            What do I need to start a blog right away?<br>
            1. A good name <br>
            2. Great photos <br>
            3. People to meet with

            <strong>How we know each other</strong>
            <br>
            Rishi is on my

              personal board of directors.
            </a> 
            Whenever I am making a big life change, he is one of the people I consult.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've been thick as thieves since 4th grade. He and I grew up around the corner from one another in Huntington Beach, CA. We spent many afternoons at our parents' houses working on group projects, studying for Mr. Duval's biology tests, and helping each other understand math homework.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lifelong lover of music, Rishi gave me my first Radiohead album (The Bends) for my 16th birthday, which I listened to on repeat in my first car (because it was better than my other cds: Blink 182 Cheshire Cat, Mariah Carey Emotions, etc). He also burned me my first mixed-cd. Remember that?! Before iTunes, Spotify, and Soundcloud? At Mesa View Middle School, bottom of the totem pole 6th grade Rishi quickly became The Man when he started selling ten-song compilation compact discs of everyone's favorite jams. Each cd cost you $10, and soon, Rishi had started his first company and was a middle school stud.
            </p>
            <p>
              He went south to UC San Diego, me north to UC Santa Barbara and we kept in touch until we both moved to LA after college. 
            </p>
            <p>Now, the forever clever entrepreneur and hip Silverlake home owner just launched two new companies. The first, a small music management company called High5 Management, and the second, a digital marketing arm of a 
              <a target="_blank" href="http://theuprisingcreative.com/">
                stellar boutique media company</a>, 
              which he's named
              <a target="_blank" href="http://versus-digital.com/">Versus Digital</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course he started two new companies! Of course he's killing it!
            </p>
            <p>
              I've always known that Rishi would be successful. He is kind, smart, calculated, and can bridge business + creative in an industry that is filled with mostly super creative people with no business sense OR business people with no dedication to the art. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Discoveries</strong> <br>
              When I've come to Rishi in moments of transition, he has constantly ended our deep detailed brainstorms and conversations with the words, "I'm not worried about you. You'll be fine, Linds."
            </p>
            <p>
              Those two sentences have always been really comforting. Maybe because I hope my closest friends and family see something special in me that I can't see. Sometimes, all we need to push forward is to hear that someone we love and trust believes in us.

            <strong>How we know each other</strong> <br>
            Ally is the one of the wisest women I know. 
          </p>
          <p>
            She floated into my life like Glinda the Good Witch of the North in a moment of transition and uncertainty. It was 2010 in Nelson, Canada when I was working on an indie thriller film called 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a3B5qXlXtU">
              <em>The Tall Man.</em>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nelson is a special little mountain town with a population of 10,000 people. Ally had been living between Alberta (where she is from) and Nelson for the past couple years. The tiny hippie haven was her home away from home. She was recommended to me when I was looking for a private yoga instructor. I knew right away that she was magic. Ally provided otherworldly insight about the cosmos and introduced me to the concepts of 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://saturnsisters.com/whats-the-saturn-return/">Saturn Return</a>, 
            Native American 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drstandley.com/nativeamerican_animal_medicine.shtml">animal medicine</a>, 
            and reading Tarot (to name a few). Her perspectives opened my mind up to thinking about the world a little differently.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <span>“</span>I choose to practice connection through prayer, all-night dance, refined asana, meditation, and devotion to the Light and by creating good-relations.<span>”</span>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            We kept in touch on and off. Every time we spoke, Ally's first question was, "How's your heart?" I always thought that was a beautiful way to start a conversation. Then a fateful surprise 2012 Brooklyn run-in pulled her back into my life again. I was walking into a Williamsburg sushi restaurant I had never been to before. She was walking out, and we came nose to nose around a corner. It took us both a few beats to put the facial puzzle pieces together and recognize the person standing opposite *BIG HUG.* Turned out, she had migrated from that bitty Canadian town to the bustling metropolis of NYC!
          </p>
          <p>
            WE ARE NOW BOTH LIVING IN NEW YORK (I didn't see that coming). This city is so fortunate to have her energy in residence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Discoveries</strong> <br>
            During one of our epic Nelson yoga sessions, we were in a pose on hands and knees. Right arm raised parallel to the floor, reaching for the front wall. Left leg lifted parallel to the floor, toes stretching toward the back wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Linds, your energy is splaying outward. Find your center. Pull your intentions into your heart center. Focus your energy inward." 
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether or not she meant it, I took the adjustment as a metaphor for my life at the time. I had been a personal assistant to a close actress friend of mine for the four years prior. When you're a natural people pleaser, it's easy to construct a sense of self around providing for others. That pose was the first step in an ongoing process to find my authentic self.  
          </p>

            When we sat down for coffee recently, Ally gave me encouragement to move forward with this project. She liked the idea of 
            <em>fifty coffees</em> being about pause, reflection, and processing. She talked a lot about soul paths, which I still don't understand. So, you'll find me at 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yogashanti.com/new-york-city/">her yoga class</a> in Chelsea on Saturdays at 9:30am, where I continue a meditation aimed toward creeping closer and closer to my center.
